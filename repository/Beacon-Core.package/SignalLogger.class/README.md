It represents the abstract class of a `SignalLogger` that takes the signals going through the `Beacon` and actually does something useful.

The subclasses provide concrete implementations. Each of these sublasses can be used both by directly instantiating the class, or by using the `instance` class variable which holds a global instance of that class.
The global instance of a signal logger is useful to provide a simple means to start and stop without worrying about the instance.

For example, consider:

```
   TranscriptLogger start.
   StringSignal emit: 'test'.
   TranscriptLogger stop.
```	
Passing stop, unsubscribes the global instance of `TranscriptLogger` from the central `Beacon` instance without having to remember the `TranscriptLogger` object.

One can get signals go to a given logger during the execution of a block with:

```
   (MemoryLogger named: 'loggerA')
       runDuring: [ 
         'Hello' asBeaconSignal emit.
         42 asBeaconSignal emit.
         Object new emit.
         ];
       recordings.
```		
This can be done for a specific set of signals with:

```
   (MemoryLogger named: 'loggerA')
      runFor: StringSignal, WrapperSignal 
      during: [ 
         'Hello' asBeaconSignal emit.
         42 asBeaconSignal emit.
         StringSignal emit: 'let me pass'
         ];
      recordings.
```
		
It is possible to have signals go to several loggers by nesting `#runDuring:` blocks.
Now this is not replacing a composite logger.
